<p>Ron Shaich, founder and CEO of Panera Bread, recently participated in a novel program to better understand poverty. He agreed to live off $4.50 a day under the SNAP challenge. SNAP is the&nbsp;Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, previously known as food stamps which helps millions of Americans living in poverty.</p>
<p><img id="yui_3_5_1_5_1380182984040_496" alt="" src="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Panera-Bread-founder-CEO-Ron-Shaich-tells-Chris-Matthews-about-living-on-the-SNAP-program-MSNBC.jpg" width="615" height="345" /></p>
<p>Shaich has seen thousands of people who struggle to feed themselves and their families. &nbsp;He has visited dozens of soup kitchens, food pantries, homeless shelters and food banks, and worked closely with nonprofit organizations. However in his own words: &#8220;I had no clue,&#8221; how difficult it was to survive like the people he&#8217;d witnessed. &nbsp; His SNAP Challenge taught him that merely observing someone else&#8217;s plight does not hold a candle to consciously altering your habits to better understand what it might be like to live someone else&#8217;s life. Under this challenge, he lived on a food and beverage budget of $4.50 a day, the average amount a recipient of food stamps gets in benefits.</p>
<p>He quickly saw the reality of being hungry. &nbsp;Shaich was forced to monitor how much food was left in the fridge and how many dollars were left in his wallet. &nbsp;He admits eating portions that were too big, and wasn&#8217;t sure what to do if his food ran out. This caused him a great deal of anxiety and uncertainty. He saw the trials of feeding himself on such a minimal amount. &nbsp; Eighty percent of households that have problems putting food on the table include the most vulnerable members of our society: &nbsp; &nbsp;children, the elderly and the disabled.</p>
<p>In this challenge, Shaich had to quickly change everything about his daily life. &nbsp;He had toasted oats for Breakfast and snacks. Lunch and dinner varied between chickpea, jalapeno and tomato soup, lentil casserole and pasta with tomato sauce and garlic. He only drank water and gave up coffee because it didn&#8217;t fit within the budget. Luxuries such as fresh fruit, vegetables and yogurt were too expensive.. Shaich said his new diet made him &#8221; listless and grumpy&#8221;. The sad reality is one-in-six people, or roughly 48 million Americans, face this tragedy daily. Unlike the challenges of many Americans living off this diet, Shaich admits he wasn&#8217;t worrying about his car breaking down or not being able to pay for gas or having my electricity turned off or finding work or paying an unforeseen medical bill. For our fellow Americans, the reality is it is about deciding whether to eat or buy heart medicine or diabetic drugs. As Shaich says: &#8221; It&#8217;s not about whether or not food is boring. It&#8217;s about living.&#8221;</p>
<p><img id="yui_3_5_1_5_1380183083915_616" alt="" src="http://media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/78/45/24/7845245048ab25aef1d6e7d6cd23f412.jpg" width="546" height="364" /><br />
However, the debate we often hear in Washington leads to thinking that the issue can be seen in black or white, right or wrong, good or bad. In this discussion, Shaich acknowledges critics of the program by saying that he has &#8220;no doubt&#8221; that there are some people who accept SNAP benefits when they either don&#8217;t need the assistance or may not use them appropriately. However, this can be seen with any large or complex system, such as SNAP.</p>
<p>In closing, Shaich recognizes that government is only part of the solution. He challenges his corporate allies to address this complex problem as well. At Panera, the company has tried to stretch itself to think of how to address hunger in new ways. Five nonprofit &#8220;Panera Cares&#8221; community cafes with no set prices and have donated hundreds of millions of dollars in products to food banks. Panera firmly believes that we must take care of the world that we live in or there won&#8217;t be any society left to support us. Hunger exists in every community, in every county, in every state. Shaich concludes: &#8220;this is our problem to solve, and it&#8217;s time to do so.&#8221; It is time for more Americans to recognize this problem and take a proactive approach in helping our fellow citizens. This can and must be a public-private partnership with government, private industry, the faith community, and all others working to help the least among us.</p>

			Major R. Click is a founding member of Click. McGhee, serving as the firm's president and CEO. This Birmingham native hails from a diverse background and has a proven track record as a leader. His long history of working behind the scenes in an effort to get things done speaks for itself. Major and the Click. McGhee are primed and positioned to get things done.
Major was called into politics at an early age. After his sixteenth birthday, Major began working for prominent criminal defense attorney, the late David Cromwell Johnson, who was representing former Alabama Governor, Jim Folsom.  As Johnson’s assistant, this “early bloomer” quickly realized that he had found his passion, leading him to pursue a career in public service.
While obtaining his degree in Political Science at the University of South Alabama, Major was selected to work in Washington DC as a Congressional Intern for U.S. Representative, Earl Hilliard. Following his internship, Major went to work for Governor Don Siegelman, supporting his efforts to bring an education lottery to the state of Alabama.
After working for Siegelman, Major worked tirelessly in an effort to assist former Alabama Court of Civil Appeals Judge, Sharon Yates, in her bid for the state’s top judicial post of Chief Justice. After graduation, he devoted himself for two years, to the Alabama Democratic Senate Caucus, working as their Finance Director.  
In 2004, Major was presented with an opportunity he could not refuse resulting in his return to our nation’s capital to work for the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in and effort to elect the Kerry-Edwards ticket. Upon his return to Birmingham in 2005, Major worked with the Retirement Systems of Alabama (RSA), Ross Bridge Resort. While working for RSA, he quickly excelled in areas of public relations and marketing.
In 2007, Major was hired as a federal contractor for the department of Housing and Economic Development (HUD). Throughout his three-year contract with HUD, Major specialized in helping turn distressed properties into communities for low-income families to call home. After the contract ended, Affordable Housing continue to be an area of special interest for Major.
In the 2010 election cycle, Major worked with various progressive candidates throughout the state in an effort to create a better Alabama. During this time, he was recruited by Summit Housing Partners to serve as a Regional Portfolio Manager. His position entailed working with Section 8 and tax credit properties in order to facilitate expanded access and affordable housing to more Alabamians. 
Following his contract with Summit, Major worked with Jefferson County, Judge Bob Vance, in an effort to help defeat, the once removed, Chief Justice Roy Moore. Most recently, Major worked with the City of Birmingham Economic Development department, working to retain and attract new business to the “Magic City”. As a native of the city, Major truly sees the magic in the city and in her people.

Clearly a man with a track record in politics, Major understands the landscape as well as the players, making him an asset to any candidate, cause or interest. His political background, combined with his experience in marketing, PR and economic development will enable Major to be an asset to all of those he serves. His experience, wisdom and charismatic style position him to play a diplomatic role in facilitating positive change within today's increasingly challenging environment.
When Major is not working, he can also be seen on Birmingham View, Wednesday mornings at 6:30 on UPN 68, offering political analysis and insight into issues affecting our city, state, and nation. He enjoys reading, sports (especially his beloved Crimson Tide), thoroughbred racing, current events,  live jazz ,cigars, history, museums and travel.		</div><!-- #author-description -->

				<p>i think Ron Shaich, founder and CEO of Panera Bread, is innocent about poor people. rich people that are not self-made have no idea how it feel to be this low economically. one thing would help his employees. if you feed everyone but your workers knowing you barely paying them enough to pay rent; something&#8217;s wrong.</p>

				<p>OMG&#8230;  Here&#8217;s a little dose of reality for everyone.  I am a disabled widow with an autistic 15.5 year old son.  I am not able to collect the widow&#8217;s benefit from my deceased husband&#8217;s social security until I am fifty years old which is many years away.  My son loses his father&#8217;s social security benefit when he turns 16.  Why are we both out of luck?  Because that&#8217;s the way it is.  My husband committed suicide, so there were no death benefits for us from his job, either.  Our SNAP benefits are $200 per month.  I do without for myself because my teenaged son eats everything&#8230;  I am able to eat one meal a day.  Usually it&#8217;s so high in sodium and low in protein that I am surprised I am still alive. Organic food?  Fresh vegetables and fruit?  We can&#8217;t afford them. I understand that SNAP benefits are supposed to &#8220;supplement&#8221; my disability income, after I pay for my medicare, I get $822 a month for EVERYTHING else.  We live in a large city because that&#8217;s we don&#8217;t have enough to move to a smaller city that may or may not be a better value.  We have a crazy, yes, I said crazy, Republican governor who turned down millions to secure the state health care fund, he dismantled collective bargaining for unions, and he is trying to privatize every entity of government he can get away with because he has &#8220;political aspirations&#8221; that go beyond this state.  The man is delusional, but he&#8217;s working his way up in his mind.  The job he had before he became the governor?  He dismantled the mental health system.  Not coincidental, but, that&#8217;s the reason my severely depressed and suicidal husband was only committed for 5 days total after a severe overdose where I had to resuscitate him as the paramedics that my ten year old son had to call and bring up to where I was doing CPR on him.  That was his third attempt in a month.  There was a court hearing where I testified for his committal and he was back in our home five days later.  One month later he was dead.  He did it at work in front of all of his colleagues who were MD&#8217;s.  Even they couldn&#8217;t save him.</p>
<p>Now, try to think again about berating the people who receive those &#8220;handouts&#8221; of SNAP benefits.  I WISH we got $4.50 a day for each of us.  I am horrified that these out of touch with the &#8220;common&#8221; folk politicians and CEO&#8217;s have so much control over the minds of the tax paying sheeple that are seeing their agenda as the right way to go.  </p>
<p>I wish we could afford to eat at Panera.  He just got some really great publicity for his huge corporation. *clap* *clap*  Way to go!  How about handing out some free meal coupons for all the SNAP recipients in this country?  You can afford it!  It&#8217;s more free publicity, and I&#8217;m sure it would be a great write off!  I&#8217;ll be expecting ours in the mail!  That would actually help everyone!</p>
<p>ok, down off of the soapbox&#8230;</p>

				<p>The Repubs would tell you that it&#8217;s all about making bad choices.  So&#8230; build a time machine, go back in time, have your son born not autistic, and have your husband not commit suicide.   You choose to become some kind of CEO on Wall Street and make millions&#8230;.. see?  No problem.  It&#8217;s all about choices.  Now, on our planet &#8211; the one that&#8217;s NOT sociopathic &#8211; folks like you are our own people, and we need to help our own people over some rough spots not of their choosing.  Something here about Christianity&#8230; caring&#8230; helping&#8230; I dunno.</p>

				<p>I applaud Ron Shaich.  I took on the food stamp challenge with a twist:  97% organic.  Not just for one week but for two.  Then the Huffington Post published my blog.<br />

				<p>Why is the company spending hundreds of millions of dollars on &#8220;non profit&#8221; &#8220;I feel so great about myself and can talk about the outreach of my company,&#8221; and not simply raising the salaries of his own employees, especially those that live in big, expensive cities?  I always find it hypocritical that a company would have a non-profit, but continue to pay the people who clean its toilets and dishes a price scarcely about minimum wage, which is shockingly low and an amount that all but guarantees suffering and sickness?</p>

				<p>SNAP = SUPPLEMENTAL Nutrition Assistance Program. It&#8217;s meant as a supplement to &#8212; not for paying for all &#8212; foods purchases. So all this talk of &#8220;I can&#8217;t live off $3.50 a day&#8221; nonsense needs to stop. You cannot live entirely off it because you are not meant to. I have never and likely will never be on food stamps so you can call me naive if you want, but take the program for what it&#8217;s mean to be &#8211; a temporary supplement to your existing income in order to purchase food. </p>
<p>To singlequeergrrl, as a taxpayer, it is absolutely my business whether or not they purchase booze. It is people like me that pays for these programs. Therefore, for some idiot to abuse it by selling SNAP benefits for 50 cents on the dollar so they can buy alcohol or cigarettes is fraud and misappropriation of my tax dollars.</p>

				<p>Your answer just made me VERY angry. The reason is that there are so many people who cannot &#8220;supplement&#8221; their food benefits &#8212; many can&#8217;t find jobs, are disabled, or worse yet, they work at jobs that don&#8217;t allow them to pay for rent an utilities, thus they need the benefits. If I was under those conditions, I might want a drink too, but from what I saw living in the ghetto and working with the poor, life is miserable enough to want to escape it any way I could. I didn&#8217;t do it, but I can understand it.  </p>
<p>You, as a taxpayer, need to be more compassionate and less stingy. Petition the government to make corporations pay tax rates commensurate with individual filers. Demand reallocation of taxes from ridiculous security schemes and have them funnel it into social services. Stop whining about how much you have to pay, because compared to a lot of places, you don&#8217;t pay much tax at all.</p>

				<p>I suggest you donate all extra cash you have, teachbygoofyaccent, to these programs on your own, instead of trying to guilt others into paying more and being more &#8220;compassionate.&#8221;  Stingy?  How much do you personally donate, other than your taxes that you&#8217;re forced to pay?  </p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure this forced compassion got us into the current economic mess that we&#8217;re in now.  Want to help people?  Then do it.  Don&#8217;t petition for more taxes.</p>

				<p>Amen Teach.<br />
Let Harry bitch and cry about his taxes all he wants &#8211; he still has to pay.<br />
A true patriot pays their taxes and is proud that it helps the less fortunate.<br />
People like Harry don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re talking about&#8230; they have their fat heads under a tin foil hat with antennae tuned to Fox News.<br />
Keep the faith &#8230;. things will get better as people become more aware of what&#8217;s really going on out there &#8211; that&#8217;s what this article is about.</p>

				<p>My mother-in-law is 84 years old, she has a monthly income of just over $700. She receives $10 in food stamps. When my grandparents were alive and received just over $500 a month combined, they too only received $10 in food stamps. These are elderly people with fixed incomes getting very little to feed themselves. You really need to pull your head out of your backside.</p>

				<p>Shawn, you think just because you happen to pay taxes, you can tell other people what to do with their federal benefits and social assistance money? Don&#8217;t be so ignorant and absurd. If that is true, then how about I just march on over to your place and start bossing around your grandparents or anyone in your family who is on Medicare, and tell them what medicines I think they should buy, and what I think is wasteful about how they live their life? Mind your own business, and stop being so holier-than-thou. Everyone pays taxes, you&#8217;re not special. Even people who are on food stamps pay taxes.</p>

				<p>I like the people saying that you arent supposed to live off SNAPS&#8230; but once you start working they lower it.. </p>
<p>Now reread that sentence&#8230; and realize that people WORKING qualify for foodstamps</p>
<p>I just moved after my mother passed away, bought myself a junker with money left by my mother&#8230;and am currently looking for work (was told to return Monday when they review the online applications at Starbucks, so cross your fingers for tomorrow!),&#8230; as a single mother I qualify for 300 a month in foodstamps. I have no other income as of yet.. so that is 10 dollars a day for me and my 2 year old.</p>
<p>Soon, I have to go complain about how I have never received child support&#8230; since they finally were able to track down the POS dad just 3 months ago.. right before my mother died.. (I had informed them when my son was born late 2011&#8230; and it took them that long to get a hold of him&#8230; and yes I knew who it was, dont be a dick).</p>
<p>So yea.. me and my kid get 50 cents more than that ceo guy&#8230; I&#8217;m such a leech on your taxes.. God should smite me!</p>
<p>P.S. The money rich people save on tax evasions and cuts could be used to feed the hungry in america 5 times over&#8230;. wouldnt even need any of the tax money from the people replying here lol..Oh and in case you are Christian&#8230; Jesus never said &#8220;Help the poor&#8230; unless you think they suck.&#8221;</p>

				<p>The key word here is &#8220;Supplemental&#8221; . SNAP is meant to assist you with shopping for food, not for McDonalds, Burger King ect&#8230; Food Stamps and snap were NEVER meant to be your only source of paying for food. And I have been tight on money many long times in my life. I always managed to cut out excessive spending to afford food. I struggle to see people who need &#8220;help&#8221; who also have smartphones, name brand clothes, sneakers that cost more then I make in 2 days at work. Who want more ! And yet we still have no restrictions on how you spend you money when you apply for tax payers money(assistance) !!!!!!!</p>

				<p>Once again, people who don&#8217;t understand that these people are not middle class or in their own situation. But a lot of retail workers who cannot afford bills after paying for their bills. Stop thinking that the minority of those who are on food stamps all mooch off the system or have name brand clothing and smartphones&#8230;</p>

				<p>And even with name brand, they actually do sell those at thrift stores like Salvation Army and Goodwill. And smartphones are no longer a luxury item. In many cases, a smart phone is the only access a person has to the internet, not a minor thing with so many services being available only online.</p>

				<p>I like it when people that have been over privileged for so long take a step back to see how the rest of us are doing. You can argue the politics of giving out snap all you want but until you have experienced it for yourself your point will most likely be invalid. The amount of people that are jobless, homeless and/ or disabled in this country is mind blowing, and the statistics aren&#8217;t an accurate representation. They only count what they can see, and the truth is the people living at the bottom often times cant afford to be seen. I have heard over privileged arguments saying things like &#8220;those people put themselves in that  position&#8221; or &#8220;they are just lazy&#8221;. Do you know how much actual physical work happens for minimum wage or less than minimum wage? the reason they pay so little is because the work is so hard but they know they have a mile long line of replacements when you cant do it anymore. The higher people in this country get paid the less physically demanding the jobs become, but on the same coin the more mentally demanding. This is why you see more CEO&#8217;s and business people going to psychologists and more poor workers getting physically injured and going to the hospital. When a CEO goes to a shrink, their medical insurance provides for it, when a worker goes to the ER (probably with no medical insurance because rarely do min wage jobs give you anything other than min wage) L&amp;I might pay for it but most likely they are left with a huge bill and no job. So they are left with govt. subsidies to live off of until they heal, if they heal. And if they don&#8217;t they are disabled. The job that they were working is now filed with another worker that will eventually hurt themselves and join the ranks of the disabled. I&#8217;m sure someone is going to comment about how i left something out, or misspelled something or they are going to try to denounce my claim, to you go f*** yourself. This is what happens here, where i live, I see it everyday in the food bank line. Sure there are drug addicts and drunks and lazy people everywhere that alter your perception. They are the ones you see. But the same people live in the middle and the top as well and you don&#8217;t complain when they get tax write offs and bailouts do you?</p>

				<p>Great Points Mike! People have no understanding because they have never experienced it. You can only live in 2 states in this country working 40 hours a week on minimum wage. If you lived in NJ you would need to work 88 hours a week to afford a basic apartment, not counting additional costs like Insurance or Food&#8230;.</p>

				<p>Experience has shown that the more money you have, the more money you spend!  Hence the lottery winners who 5 years later are broke again!  It&#8217;s actually harder for me now that I&#8217;m earning a decent living than it was when I was a broke college kid.  Why? Because before I knew any better, I spent everything I made!  People were always telling me I should make a budget and follow it, but no one taught me HOW!!  Increasing SNAP benefits and raising minimum wage will help those in need ONLY if it is coupled with intense money management training and assistance with making a monthly budget.  This instruction should be required ongoing learning beginning no later than the freshman year of high school. Too many kids drop out or even graduate with no idea how to balance a checkbook, much less how to make and stick to spending on a budget.<br />
If minimum wage is increased to a living wage, and SNAP benefits are increased without money management training, people will have more money but will still be broke all the time!!</p>

				<p>I agree completely Twyla. Good thoughts. So many people do not know how to manage their money. And live outside of their means. Food stamps were meant to be an inbetween to help people get on their feet or in rough times but the problem is that people use this as their main source of income/food instead of a SUPPLEMENT when things aren&#8217;t going well or they don&#8217;t make enough to make ends meet. </p>
<p>Also more people need to learn about good nutrition. and that is not the old food pyramid chock full of soy, canola, corn, and wheat. That is what is making people so sick and undernourished today. We need to subsidize broccoli, carrots, and apples&#8230;not soy, corn and wheat so that these more nutritious foods are more available to people. </p>
<p>Another sad state is how much food goes to waste in this country. We could feed EVERYONE for free with all the wasted food that gets thrown out but instead could actually be used to feed people. But not with the bureaucracy we have standing in the way. &gt;_&lt;</p>

				<p>I worked for Panera Bread as a manager. Reviews were given to associated twice a year, although raises were handed out once a year.  The cafe was busy, it was staffed at over 50 associates.  When it came time for raises, the cafe had $3.40 to disperse amongst the associates.  Eliminating those that may have had performance  issues, or those that were new, that was $3.40 to be split amongst 40 associates.  If you haven&#8217;t already done the math, that isn&#8217;t even .09 cents an hour.  So when an associate would come up to me and say I&#8217;m hungry, yes I fed that person.  There are boxes at the counter to contribute to the Feed America, but I think we have an obligation to take care of our own before we try to reach out on a broadar note.  And as a reminder Panera Bread, in many areas is corporate which means they are all about the bottom line.  And although they are generous with those organizations that they support, little thought is given if presented with helping others.  I attempted to get approved to participate in the Toys for Tots program this Christmas, and was turned down.  Silly me, I thought what a great charity to be paired with especially to help kids.  That was the deciding factor for me, and I am now with an organization that with participate in the Toys for Tots program  this Christmas and has encouraged me to share my ideas to give back with the other managers.  You won&#8217;t see it in the newspapers, tv, or internet&#8230;&#8230;that&#8217;s the difference when things are done for the right reason&#8230;&#8230;..</p>

				<p>I gave each of  my children, ages 20 and 22, $200  per month for purchasing food while they were living without food plans in college. I explained to them I would give them the same amount in cash as a single person gets for food stamps in our county. Both children were able to feed themselves with healthy food choices as they became careful shoppers. Sometimes their choices for variety was quite limited, but neither child bought processed or prepared foods which tend to be costly. Both children also shopped at discount grocery stores and taking advantages of sales and coupons.</p>

				<p>Carolyn,  a few questions&#8230;.  What year was this?  What section of the country?  Was there a big choice of walkable food sources?  Did they have to buy household items like toilet paper?  Did they have vehicles that would allow them to go to the best sales?  Was the vehicle expense part of the $200 you provided.  Please&#8230;.</p>

				<p>I notice that I have gotten some flak over my benefit amount assumptions. I do understand that everyone&#8217;s benefit is different. My intention was to demonstrate that the amount that they assumed that you would need for food as a full benefit was adequate to feed a family with good nutritious meals every day. I wanted to show that it was not necessary to live on hamburger and non nutritious foods using their assumed food budget. I have used this food budget for a very long time and do understand how to make it work.</p>
<p>SNAP stands for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and was intended to supplement the food budget not replace it. Thus as your income rose, they expected you to devote some of your earnings towards your food budget. Now given the modern situation with restrictions on income eligibility, this is no longer a reasonable assumption. I certainly do believe that the current income restrictions are inappropriate and hurt a lot of people. When costs for everything goes up and wages or assistance in coping with price increases don&#8217;t, people&#8217;s situations become worse.</p>
<p>We do need to work on this by both fixing the laws and securing a living wage. Certainly raising the minimum wage would help, but even at $11.00/ hr, an adequate SNAP benefit is needed  The current effort to destroy SNAP is a very bad idea..</p>

				<p>you are a fool. Snap is an acronym, not an adequate measure of the amount or percentage that the subsidy represents of a persons disposable income. For some people 4.50 a day is all they have to spend for food when all other expenses are included. Furhermore even if someone has access to credit to allow them to purchase supposed luxuries, it doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;ll have te funds to pay the bill in full when its due. Most people in this country live check to check, and to begrudge occassional indulgences, especially considering that the wealthy depend upon this spending, is simulataneously illogical and heartless.</p>

				<p>The problem with it these days comes from exactly that acronym. Remember back in the day, it was just &#8220;food stamps.&#8221; As in, something you use to buy food. The minute they changed it to &#8220;SUPPLEMENTAL nutrition,&#8221; they were sending a subtle message that &#8220;Yeah, here&#8217;s a little extra.&#8221; Back before they TEApublicans rose to power, you could get by on food stamps. But between them cutting funding, and the benefits amount not keeping up with inflation, now it is truly &#8220;supplemental.&#8221; At this rate, in five years it&#8217;ll be called &#8220;Barely Anti-Starvation Rationing Dispensary.&#8221; Or &#8220;BAStaRD,&#8221; for short.</p>

				<p>Larry You are wrong on several fronts. If you get SNAP, the entire amount is loaded onto the card at the beginning of the month. There is nothing that stops you from investing in staples or making good choices when ingredients are on sale. Not having a freezer might limit you some in prebuying perishables, but you can adapt.</p>
<p>Secondly, Note that a family of 3 receives a maximum benefit of $526 per month or $17.50 per day. A single person gets $ 200 or $6.60 per day<br />
<a href="https://www.azdes.gov/main.aspx?menu=355&#038;id=5202" rel="nofollow">https://www.azdes.gov/main.aspx?menu=355&#038;id=5202</a> shows the AZ numbers.</p>
<p>According to the USDA, the average per person benefit is about $ 134 per month or $ 4.65 per day although single people get less. This works out to $14.00 per day for a family of 3.<br />
<a href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/pd/18SNAPavg$PP.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fns.usda.gov/pd/18SNAPavg$PP.htm</a> for averages.</p>
<p>If you can&#8217;t feed your 3 person family on $17.40 per day ($526 / month), then you are doing something wrong. You must be eating frozen prepared food, expensive meat, soda, junk food, wasting food or buying national brands rather than the same store brand foods at half the cost. This is my food budget and I meet it every month (usually under), although I don&#8217;t include beer or wine since that is not SNAP eligible anyway. We eat good food in balanced meals because I cook from ingredients, not packages. I use a different recipe every day</p>
<p>And I hear a lot of &#8220;I can&#8217;t&#8221; whining. Most of the rest of the world cooks nutritious meals on 1 or 2 burners and doesn&#8217;t have fridges. They don&#8217;t complain, they cook. They couldn&#8217;t get fresh meat in Hawaii during WW II, but they could get Spam. But they didn&#8217;t complain, they created a cuisine based on Spam that is still popular today. Work with the food that you can get and create good food using the tools that you have.</p>

				<p>Bill&#8230;WE GET IT. WE GET IT. You are the spirit of Martha Stewart, wrapped in the shell of Emeril Lagasse, basted liberally with Coupon Queen. Yes, we ALL understand at this point that you&#8217;ve got plenty of time to cook from three grains of flour and seven pounds of rutebegas you traded some old tin cans for. WE GET IT. You&#8217;ve got the energy of a nuclear reactor, the creativity of H.P. Lovecraft, and you probably suspend cannonballs from your testicles in the snow just to harden your resolve to grow your own corn from seed so you can feed it to chickens to make eggs for feed to give your cow so you can butcher it at the end of the year and save 12 cents a pound on beef. WE. GET. IT. </p>
<p>Now the WE. GET. YOU., I would ask that you get it through your head that not everybody is you. Not everybody knows how to cook anything that doesn&#8217;t go in a microwave, nor do they have the time or energy to learn. Some people are single parents chasing three kids around, they&#8217;re old, physically or mentally disabled, living in motel rooms, selling their food stamps to pay the electric bill, or any number of a hundred other reasons that they can&#8217;t do all the shit you you. Or maybe they just WON&#8217;T. Maybe they could hypothetically learn to cook, or find the time, sleep an hour less a night so they have time to clean the kitchen afterward, pay for the extra electricity to run that oven and two burners, or keep the cockroaches off their counters long enough to cook anything&#8230;WHATEVER. But they don&#8217;t, and they&#8217;re not. </p>
<p>The minute you&#8217;d like to institute a social welfare program to teach people Home Ec and time management skills so they can eat organically grown filet mignon paninis on the money you spend on chicken feed, then go right the Hell ahead. You&#8217;re obviously an amazing individual, and everyone could learn from your wisdom. Or maybe you&#8217;re just average, and everyone else is a piece of shit.</p>
<p>The point isn&#8217;t what you can or can&#8217;t do in YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION, with YOUR particular set of skills, with the time and energy at YOUR disposal, or how YOU have a fresh fish market down the street that sells salmon for 9 cents a pound off on Wednesdays. The point is what&#8217;s actually HAPPENING. In the Real World. For the rest of humanity. That&#8217;s the reality that needs to be dealt with, however it gets dealt with. If you have a problem with what&#8217;s being sold, then write a letter to the FDA. Write a letter to the Board of Education. Start a damned movement, or a petition to make everyone as wonderful and wise as you. </p>
<p>But until then, open your damned eyes and look what&#8217;s really happening. People are going hungry. For whatever reason, whoever&#8217;s to blame, that&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening. And until your social and educational programs, and FDA reforms, kick in, I&#8217;m afraid the only real solution is to just give them more goddamned money.</p>

				<p>Bill feeding a family on things like spam is not healthy.  Yes people could eat on  what they get in food stamps but most of it would not be nutritional and sustaining.  Do you know why so many of the poor are over weight?  The food they have to live on is crap.  It costs a buck to get a box of max and cheese yet over five to get some good fruit.  which one on a strict budget will the person take.  get real.</p>

				<p>Expensive meat? I just bought chicken quarters for my family for dinner and it was just over $12. So if we were living off $17.50 a day, that would mean I had $5.50 to cover all the rest of my food for the entire day.</p>
<p>You may be lucky enough to live somewhere that you can get food at a lower cost, but that is not the case for many lower income people.</p>

				<p>Bill, you need to get real. I was receiving SNAP benefits for awhile, to the tune of $146 a month. Yes, it&#8217;s loaded onto a card on a specific date each month (which day depends on your county ID number). That money helped me to provide nutritious meals for my 2 kids. I am in a wheelchair and receive SSDI. I was at Mayo Clinic for a month and while I was there, I got a letter from the county saying I had to pay back all the SNAP benefits I&#8217;d received because the county had failed to count my miniscule child support (though I&#8217;d reported it many times). That little amount pushed me over the income limit. Now I REALLY struggle to make ends meet. By the last week of the month, we are eating store brand mac and cheese and canned vegetables. Fresh fruit and veggies are never in the budget &#8211; they just cost too much. Frozen costs too much, too. So canned fruits and veggies are all I can afford. Meat is a luxury, given twice a week. Peanut butter and beans make up the protein deficiency in our diets. Milk is outrageously expensive, so we rarely get that &#8211; or cheese, for that matter. My kids are teenagers, one of whom is autistic (so he cannot work to help bring in much-needed money), and they need a lot of food for their growing bodies. As a mother, it is devastating to realize that I cannot provide the kinds of meals they should be getting. I can&#8217;t cook up a storm, as you apparently do, either. Why? because I am in a wheelchair, and only have one good hand. I&#8217;ve gotten 3rd degree burns on my thighs from spilling a pan of spaghetti sauce on it. That was a fun day (dripping sarcasm). I am the face of the poor in America. And you can bet your bottom dollar that the county is never going to get that money back from me. I don&#8217;t have a single penny to spare, especially  now that I don&#8217;t even have that little bit of help to keep my head above water. Additionally, because I no longer receive SNAP benefits, my kids no longer qualify for free lunch, only reduced-priced lunches &#8211; another expense I have to come up with &#8211; because at least at school I know they will get fresh fruit and veggies. But it often means I cannot go to doctor appointments since the trade-off is gas money for the van. You need to seriously close your mouth. You don&#8217;t have a clue what life is like for those of us who live on the bottom. But congrats on being Mister Freaking Fabulous. How nice it must be to live in your world.</p>

				<p>..and to think, as we get older we do NOT process foods the same way. When you are younger you can get away with crappy eating for a while&#8230;then vitamin deficiencies cause a small amount of sickness and the body and it will weaken over time. You can look forward to that starting in your 30s..which will happen to everyone. You really only have your 20s to early 30s to do all the things you thought you would do..guess what&#8230;hardly anyone gets that..because the system screws right out of college now&#8230;.you are enslaved at that point in this generation. It used to be we enslaved ourselves by having kids early&#8230;but now..who wants to have kids with 70k in debt? And why? So we can be in perpetural financial slavery for the next 20 &#8211; 30 years? There are no rewards now in this country. All the money is flowing upwards. They are taking our livelihoods right out of school.</p>

				<p>I have seen the system abused, my oldest cousin used to get food stamp cards and sell them and use the money for drugs.. but I have also been on food stamps, for a family of 6 we got very little, with a mother in and out of psych wards for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and a father who worked 2 full time jobs to pay bills, we got about 200 a month. It does get hard to live off of when you break it all down, and honestly I would rather deal with the few who abuse the system than to cut it out together because of the bind it would put so many in need in. If it weren&#8217;t for gov&#8217;t assistance and help from churches, my family would have never had a sandwich or a pack of Ramen each as many nights a week as we did. So props for a CEO stepping out and getting INTO a situation rather than just observing it, and trying to actually make a difference in the world. We&#8217;re supposed to take care of each other in life, and in turn, we all get what we need instead of a select few getting most, and the rest of us in life getting scraps. </p>
<p>And no, I don&#8217;t still live of government assistance, I have two full jobs, one at On the Border and one at Best buy, and I&#8217;m in college in Texas, to be a child psychologist and will graduate next fall. Not all people who start on gov&#8217;t programs stay on them, and not all of them are just lazy f**ks who don&#8217;t want to work. Just for the people who will want to say I&#8217;m only ok with the people who lie and steal from these programs because I do it.</p>

				<p>It all sounds real good. BUT have they looked at their own employees. Hiring them with the promise of enough hours to live off of, telling them they cannot have a second job, and then after they work there awhile they cut the hours until one cannot support themselves on what hours they give them and they treat their employees like dirt.</p>

				<p>First of all, thank you, fellow Americans for giving a damn about your fellow citizens. I want to inform those complaining about the type of food purchased under the program &#8211; the UNHEALTHY CRAP is the CHEAPEST. Name brand foods go on sale all the time and are NOT good for any of us yet in certain neighborhoods, I won&#8217;t say which ones LOL &#8211; that is all that&#8217;s available on the shelves for people. Corporations have stolen MILLIONS from you and given nothing back  &#8211; how dare you complain about the steak that mom brought for her kid that month because you think it&#8217;s too much? The unhealthy options in many low income places contribute to poor health and then since you don&#8217;t want to support OBAMACARE you don&#8217;t even want them to have the option of getting cared for as a result of the poor diet they are FORCED to be on. It isn&#8217;t just blacks on welfare, it isn&#8217;t just people trying to get over on the system for about 150 bucks a MONTH in food &#8211; yeah, they&#8217;re really raking in the dough &#8211; there are elderly on the program as well as VETS who fought for you lazy *sses to have the ability to complain about feeding poor folks on your computers. How many of you are God fearing people? Do you know Jesus was a hippie who fed the poor? I&#8217;m an Atheist, and I&#8217;m adhere closer to bible as a way man should conduct themselves and care for each other more than you so called HOLY people. You&#8217;re completely DISGUSTING.</p>

				<p>Yes, that&#8217;s what Realredread was referring to&#8211;the stereotypes. And s/he is referring to those two categories as if they are mutually exclusive, rather than being one and the same. It&#8217;s the same mentality behind John McCaine saying of Obama, &#8220;He&#8217;s not a Muslim, he&#8217;s a good guy,&#8221; as if &#8220;Muslim&#8221; and &#8220;good guy&#8221; are two different things, and not one and the same. </p>
<p>Take a look at these two statements and see what I mean:</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t just blacks on welfare, there are elderly on the program and vets.&#8221;</p>
<p>Translation: It&#8217;s not just those other people that you think are on welfare, there are people like the elderly and vets on it as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not a Muslim, he&#8217;s a good guy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Translation: He&#8217;s not one of those other people, he&#8217;s a good guy.</p>
<p>Btw, for the record, I STRONGLY support not only maintaining but EXPANDING the food stamps program, and I&#8217;m glad to put my money behind that. So believe me, I&#8217;m not looking to attack Realredread, since we absolutely agree on this issue. I just had to point out that there was an underlying, implicit racial bias in that statement. I know it was completely unintentional, but it was there, and it had to be called out because otherwise it simply reinforces another stereotype (not that black people are on welfare, but that they are the &#8220;other&#8221;) even more.</p>

				<p>Try living on a SNAP program budget without any aid from the Government.<br />
My wife and I live it every day. All of our money goes to our household bills (which most of the SNAP programs enlistees get this assistance as well through Hud, energy assistance)<br />
And the entire extra goes to major medical bills that were due to a brain hemorrhage. Sure, I have good insurance; it paid 80%, but my out of pocket<br />
costs were over 35,000 dollars. No Government help here folks cuz I am in the lower middle class and don’t “qualify” for squat. So, we had to stop internet service, cancel cell phones, and all of the perks that  The SNAP programs participate enjoy by enrolling in all of the other programs, i.e.: Hud, free Obama phones, 250 fun money because they are under stress.<br />
Sorry if I show no sympathy to your cause, but I see these people every day with better shoes, smart phones, buying junk food with their SNAP cards, all boxed food in their shopping carts because they don’t want to prepare food, and worst of all, never looking for employment,<br />
While I on the other hand, spend my one day off from work at the library researching how to maintain a garden in the winter months and using their computer to bash you bleeding heart liberals for crying that the SNAP program needs more funding. BS…it needs to be better managed.</p>

				<p>Mark, WTF is &#8220;fun money&#8221;? And please please PLEASE inform yourself before you start talking about programs that you have not fully researched. There is no such thing as an &#8220;Obama phone.&#8221; If you do your research, you will find out that it is a program started under Bush and it&#8217;s ran by SafeLink (link here: <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2009/10/the-obama-phone/" rel="nofollow">http://www.factcheck.org/2009/10/the-obama-phone/</a>)<br />
And if you do your research, you will also find that the majority of SNAP recipients have at least one working household member. Most do not live in HUD housing, and most do not receive energy assistance (most of the energy assistance is used by the elderly &amp; disabled, at least in my area of the U.S. it is).</p>
<p>Matthew 7: 1-3: &#8220;Judge not, that ye be not judged.</p>
<p>2 For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.</p>
<p>3 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother&#8217;s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?</p>

				<p>Jessica perhaps you should heed your own advice. I agree fully with Mark. I was on Welfare years ago as a single Mom. I saw first hand the abuse of the system. You are wrong that only the elderly and disabled use energy assistance I saw lots of people abuse the system letting their energy bills go unpaid and pocketing the money so they can get shut off notices so HEAP would pay the bill. &#8220;Most don&#8217;t live in HUD housing&#8221; Really?? That&#8217;s only because the waiting list is usually 2 yrs. or more. Mark is right the lower middle class are the forgotten people as are small business owners. My son and his wife both work so they don&#8217;t qualify for anything. They barely get by but they don&#8217;t qualify for head start for their child. They were told they&#8217;d have to pay $200.00 a month. I worked in an ER and saw a small business owner who had a broken leg leave the ER in a splint because he said he couldn&#8217;t afford the surgery to properly fix his leg yet an illegal farm worker fractured his neck and we the taxpayers footed the $500,000.00 bill for his care. You say that at least ONE member of a SNAP household is working like that is ok? If you can&#8217;t feed your family shouldn&#8217;t everyone who is able-bodied and of age be working? One last thing when I became disabled last year they sent me a form that I could get a free phone and they sent a duplicate form and said to pass it on to a friend. Seriously??? I have a cheap cell phone and pay my own bills. You can get on Consumer Cellular and get a phone for &#8220;emergencies&#8221; for $10.00 a month. The system is broken and needs to be fixed. Help those that truly need help but the able-bodied need to get a job and pull their own weight.</p>

				<p>Perhaps mark, you should ask the employer who pays you too little to give you a raise? I&#8217;m  sick of hearing middle class whiners like you who refuse to blame your own low wages and instead insist on blaming those who have less then you have.</p>
<p>If you think you can do better by not working and getting all these phantom benefits, then do so. Simply quit and prove you can live high on the hog unemployed, or admit what you&#8217;re saying is nonsense&#8230;</p>

				<p>So you have tried to live on that kind of income then? You must have because you seem to know exactly what is going on in their lives and what they are doing wrong. Perhaps you should write a book on how to properly live on $4.50 a day. Of course you will want to spend a year or so doing it with no insurance and with a minimum wage job.and no rich friends to bail you out when things go south. Judge not lest ye be judged honey.</p>

				<p>Mark. I am sorry you have it rough, but for someone like me, I don&#8217;t feel sympathy for those who are self centered to not understand EVERYONE HAS IT ROUGH. I am sorry you didn&#8217;t qualify&#8230;I am sure it has more to do with what YOUR assets and not what you have as cash on hand or your insurance. I was married to an Air Force man for MANY years And we still had to get SNAP, until he made rank( even then we qualified but didn&#8217;t take it). Pretty shitty if you ask me. I also ended up divorced due to no fault of my own, with my kids in tow I had to start my life over. I WORK OVER 25 HOURS A WEEK and no one will let me work longer, even before Obama care and bust my ass to make it. I have to feed my kids and the state gives me 92 per person, per month!! Have you ever tried to live off of 92 dollars for food a month? Seriously? You are whining? The phones have been around for YEARS AND YEARS. EVERYONE deserves to have a way to call 911 and make doctor appointments and so on&#8230;trust me if we limited you to 250 minutes a month, you would surely hate life. I have a phone I PAY FOR WITH MY MONEY so I can get calls, No it is not an iphone, but that would be my choice anyway&#8230;the point is not everyone is a loser sucking the system. I bet the car you drive ALONE, is the reason you DO NOT qualify. I drive an older car because it makes more sense and because I do NOT live above my means so I qualify. So before you judge let us look at what is really going on. For the record I never got the money from my state&#8230;why? because I had to volunteer and  30 hours a week to receive  350 a month while also looking for a job&#8230;.and the work first program is a joke. It is geared only toward making a resume. I had experience and a resume, I just needed a job or some leads. Maybe just restructuring the system is a better idea????</p>

				<p>Now if someone would put him in a wheelchair or a walker and have him try to navigate his way into and around a Panera, he might get a clue about how difficult it is for a person who needs that assistance to get around/get a meal in one of his chain restaurants! Total struggle&#8230;and the food is not that good that it is worth it&#8230;</p>

				<p>How can anyone complain about &#8220;abuse&#8221; of food aid?  Even if undeserving people spend their food aid on food they shouldn&#8217;t have, the money at least goes to stimulate our economy.  When the banksters crashed our economy because of their stupidity and greed, Americans lost a total $49 TRILLION in wealth.  Median net worth declined from $126,400 in 2007 to $77,300 in 2010.  And the rightwing gets their frillies all in a twist about somebody eating a steak &#8211; that an American farmer grew and made a profit from &#8211; rather than mac and cheese.  I guess fraud on a $Trillion dollar scale is OK with them&#8230;. you never hear about them complaining about it, just the couch-cushion money that is food aid.</p>

				<p>I actually have seen abuse of the system. I&#8217;m not saying that it&#8217;s the majority, but it does exist. If you&#8217;re buying your brand name junk food (not the cheapest of cheap) and a couple of 20 oz bottles of cold soda from the freezer (not the bargain 2 liter bottle size) and pay for it with the EBT card in one hand and Smart Phone in the other, and your hands are well manicured, and then you whip out a roll of 20s to pay cash for your Nintendo 3DS system, I&#8217;m pretty sure you&#8217;re not starving. Again, I&#8217;m not trying to paint everyone with the same brush or imply that it&#8217;s everyone, but it does happen more often than you think.</p>

				<p>I have seen this. My former neighbors had me babysit for them and they asked me if I had change for $100 as they pulled out their wad of 100&#8242;s. Meanwhile they are using SNAP and driving quite a nice car. I on the other hand, did not have change for even a $20 and did not (and still do not) qualify for SNAP. The SNAP abuse does exist, just because you do not see it, does not mean it does not exist. I do not know if you are religious or not, but if you have never seen God, does that mean He does not exist and is only a rumor or myth? Relax, there is no reason to stress, its a simple post, not an attack on you personally&#8230; unless&#8230;.</p>

				<p>So you are telling me YOU NEVER SPEND ABOVE YOUR means or use credit right? Lets be serious here..we ALL do it at one point or another.. I work my ass off and get SNAP and you bet your ass that once a year when I get my taxes back&#8230;.THE SAME ONES I GET BACK FOR FOOD..the WHOLE 3.20 they give me a day&#8230;I splurge on my kids and family&#8230;shut up and stop judging..people are so freaking hypocritical. Everyone bitching is just as guilty of wasting money&#8230;.MONEY THAT IS USUALLY extended as credit. The system is NOT horrible because &#8220;everyone is abusing it&#8221;  IT is because no one wants to take the time to fix it and make it work. No one gives a shit about poor or struggling people it is all politics&#8230;there are many ways to restructure the system and what is ANYONE doing but trying to NOT help anyone in need. . DAMN why am I busting my ass all the time working if I CAN JUST SUCK OFF THE GOVERNMENT!! Lets get real here&#8230;I realize there may be a minority of people wasting or lying, but the MAJORITY of people REALLY need the help and in this day and age&#8230;.don&#8217;t give me the bull shit excuse they should HAVE NOTHING NICE because they are poor&#8230;. WE ALL want technology. AND most well off people I know LIVE WAY WAY ABOVE their means and if something happened to them they would be so screwed.. Come on, so a person has a phone&#8230;And I mean one they pay for, the freaking free phone isn&#8217;t shit..I had it for a month and was like screw that! So what I have a decent phone and it isn&#8217;t an Iphone. I have nice things..but where I work SELLS Nice things to me for a discount because I WORK THERE OMG I AM SO WRONG FOR OWNING THEM. I ALSO HAVE DECENT CREDIT AND NO CREDIT CARDS&#8230;.IF I want something I pay cash and save it!!! SO SHUT UP UNTIL YOU KNOW. I am so tired of ignorance.</p>

				<p>What&#8217;s worse: a cheater getting away with it while children are fed, or children starving to prevent cheating?  I&#8217;ll take children being fed, Alex.<br />
Do not judge, lest ye be judged.  You have no idea where those shoes and phone came from.  Perhaps the person you saw was buying their own groceries as well as groceries on behalf of an elderly or disabled neighbor?  When my family was briefly on food stamps in the &#8217;80 recession, my grandmother took me (a kid) to the store while my mom looked for work.  She supplemented our purchases where necessary and we would buy her milk or whatever while she bought our toilet paper and maxi pads, which were not covered.</p>

				<p>The only real problem that needs to be talked about here is human greed and the inability of people to see past their own noses. If people really cared about each other, Managers, CEO&#8217;s, business owners, bankers, corporations, etc. would take less pay and pass that money down to their employees and pay them a decent living wage so more people could be self sufficient and have no need for gov. assistance. Ronald Shaich&#8217;s salary last year was $617,308 with a total compensation of $3,354,708 for the year. Will he take less and give more to the employees? Walmart CEO&#8217;s make a $20 million dollar plus bonus each year and the employees are all on government assistance. Goodwill, Salvation army and the like, their CEO&#8217;s also make $10 to $20 million dollar bonuses, pay their employees nothing and hardly any of the money they rake in goes to help the people who really need it. I could go on and on but I hope you will all see that what I&#8217;m saying here is the biggest problem facing this world and until people start seeing the real truth&#8217;s, nothing will ever change.

				<p>Gail. You are right, I misspoke. Salvation army is one of the only charities that does really help people in need and their CEO&#8217;s take little compensation. Goodwill on the other hand, is the worst offender of greed. Their top CEO takes over $3 million each year and,, next to nothing goes to the people who really need it. But, everything else I said in my post is !00% correct, walmart being the worst of the worst offender. Have a nice day, Gail.</p>

				<p>The Red Cross helped my friends when their house burned down. In the middle of a winter snow storm  they left their house with their pajamas, not even their coats and shoes. They lost EVERYTHING. The Red Cross paid for their hotel and gave them a debit card so they can buy essentials. I am forever grateful for them. I have no idea what their CEO makes, but they are not a scam.</p>

				<p>The problem with the Salvation Army is the company is homophobic to the extreme and makes its feelings known. If you are a known LBQT person, they will not help you. I am boycotting them this year and I will no longer donate to them. It is ridiculous how much money they make on free inventory..</p>

				<p>The Salvation Army may not pay a lot to their General, but they do own the housing she lives in for free and they pay all the utilities and taxes; and they own the car she uses, and they give them a stipend for food and other things.  When you add that all up, they do pretty darn good.</p>
<p>And they are not always there to help out.  In our area I have yet to see them at local disasters (I have been working disaster services for 30 years).  If someone needs something they have, it has to be paid for.  It is not given out for free.</p>
<p>And the only folks who go out to fires and search and rescues with food and coffee for the victims and fire/police/EMS is the Red Cross.  They don&#8217;t charge for this.  They just do it.</p>
<p>And put a family who has lost their home up for several nights at a motel until they can make other arrangements to get back on their feet.  They also give them debit cards with funds on it based on their needs so they can get clothing.  And it is not a loan.  It does not have to be paid back.</p>

				<p>To all of you naysayers that say you can&#8217;t eat balanced meals on budget</p>
<p>Tonight&#8217;s dinner was oven baked parmesan breaded pork chops with sautéed green beans and herbed rice. Desert was fresh peach cobbler.<br />
I purchased a 4 pack of pork chops for $3.29 / lb on clearance (regularly $5.99 / lb) for $3.75. Since I had one left over, I planned to use it for school lunch paninis. Meat cost = $ 2.80.<br />
I used $0.10 bread crumbs from $1.00 loaf of bread, toasted and blended, 1 egg for $0.11 from eggs on sale for 18 for $1.98, $0.35 for Parmesan cheese from a shaker bottle and flour for $.10. Salt, pepper and dried herbs for $0.04 Breading cost = $0.75 for all four.<br />
Frozen green beans $0.99 / lb with about $0.25 fresh garlic, olive oil and soy sauce. Veggie cost = $1.25<br />
Rice with butter and herbs about $0.50<br />
Peach cobbler Peaches were on sale for $0.99 / lb I used $2.00 of peaches and biscuit dough recipe for $1.50 because of the butter to make 12 servings. Cost per serving = $0.30<br />
Beverages; two 12 oz milks from a $1.87 sale gallon = $0.36 plus 1 ice coffee. Cost = $0.50<br />
Total cost for this meal was $ 6.70 or $ 2.23 per serving</p>
<p>This means that I had $ 7.77 left over from my $ 14.00 average SNAP allotment for 3 people. That&#8217;s enough for a nice lunch and breakfast.</p>
<p>Tomorrow&#8217;s dinner: Salmon and spinach wrapped in filo with roast potatoes. Since salmon was on clearance for $4.99 / lb, I think that my meal cost will be around $ 8.00 or $2.70 per serving with $6.00 left over for breakfast and lunch. </p>
<p>You can eat real fresh food on this budget. Full price hamburger at $4.99 / lb plus a box of hamburger helper for $1.50 = $6.50. My meal cost the same amount. So tell me again why you are eating hamburger helper and nasty hot dogs.</p>

				<p>Sorry my late night math is faulty. The pork chop meal cost me $6.20 which leaves $7.80 from the $14.00 daily 3 person average benefit.</p>
<p>On the matter of coffee, I just bought a 34.5 oz can of Kroger Value coffee for $5.29. It is good coffee and not bitter. Compare that to two $10.00 or more bags of designer coffee. Do you really need the fancy bag and name?</p>

				<p>Where do you live? A gallon of milk costs 5 bucks where I live. I&#8217;m also lactose intolerant so I have to drink soy or almond with my bijou self which costs 4.99 a half gallon. At my local meat market, chicken starts at 3$ a lb. I don&#8217;t know where you live that you can afford SALMON. I&#8217;m not even on FS and I can&#8217;t afford salmon. 3 lbs of gr beef &#8211; 8.29. Spinach is never less than 4$ at 5oz.. Sorry if I don&#8217;t buy the expired meat they dyed to make look fresh because it&#8217;s cheaper.</p>

				<p>I live in Arizona. </p>
<p>One gallon of milk is regularly priced at $2.59 per gallon but I got it on sale. When they mark meat down at my grocery, all they do is slap a mark down sticker on it. The original package is never disturbed. They usually mark it down 2 days before the &#8220;sell by date&#8221; which is long before the meat will spoil. They refuse to sell any meat that is even close to bad here and if it is off, they will refund you without question. I have watched them markdown the meat.</p>
<p>Salmon is generally readily available at markdown and then it does cost the same as decent ground beef..I think that they have a hard time selling at full price in this economy, but they do need to stock it.</p>
<p>I always use frozen spinach to cook with at $1.00 per 10 oz packet unless I am making a wilted spinach dish or a salad where fresh spinach is necessary. I always buy store brand because it is the same stuff without the cost of brand name and advertising. </p>
<p>The cheap extruded beef in the plastic tube is gross and I never use it. Our regular ground beef runs $3.99 / lb for the grease laden 70/30 stuff and $4.99 / lb for good meat. Coincidentally, they had petite sirloin steaks on sale today for &#8220;buy 1 pack get 2 free&#8221; for $8.99 / lb. That works out to $3.00 / lb for steak. Would you rather eat steak or nasty ground beef that costs more per pound.</p>
<p>Food City run by Bashes is the supermarket in our poorer areas, although they also exist throughout the city. It has the same food selection as my market with additions that reflect food preferences in the neighborhood. They have Nopales and cactus pears, tripe, bulk 50 lb rice and beans, fresh tortillas and the best Chorizo. Their prices are similar to ours. I can&#8217;t get these items in my local store. I can&#8217;t say what other cities groceries are like, but I have shopped at Food City because I used to work near one..</p>

				<p>Bill, with all due respect, I don&#8217;t know where you get your numbers.  When all of the government automatic budget cuts went into effect, my hours were cut suddenly and drastically.  We had to file for SNAP benefits.  Our monthly allotment for 5 people was 420.00 this means that we have 84 dollars a month per person, roughly 2.80 per day or .93 per meal per person.  So a meal that costs 2.23 per serving exceeds the meal budget per person by  1.30 cents per person.  That is a meal and a half over budget per person.  Using this as a sample budget meal would lead to a cost of 33.45 a day to feed my family &#8230;.on a budget of 13.95 from SNAP.  If I did that my benefits would be exhausted in only 12.5 days.  My family lives mostly on oatmeal, rice, beans, veggies from our garden and sale items.  We still run out of benefits about a week before the month ends.  Now we aren&#8217;t complaining. We aren&#8217;t meant to live on this only to get by in short hard times but no one should suggest it is an easy free ride or some bonanza.  It is terribly difficult especially if you have no food preparation knowledge to speak of or work two jobs and have no time to prepare food as, contrary to popular belief, many recipients do.  We should all find a way to help those with benefits fare better when they must lean on them and have more compassion and make fewer assumptions about their character.</p>

				<p>I posted my sources earlier in the comment section. They come from official USDA average benefit figures. But everyone&#8217;s benefit amounts are adjusted by income. I did not use the full amount, but rather the average amounts to determine my budget.  .</p>

				<p>In AZ, Organic milk is $5.00 per gallon and name brand milk is $4.00. The store brand is $3.59 per gallon. Milk is $5.00 per gallon in Canada where they have no price supports.</p>
<p>Where do you live that food is that expensive?</p>

				<p>Bill tell us how you made the purchases. What I mean by this was what stores, how did you get to the store? How much of it was lower cost because you were able to purchase more in bulk?  See part of the problem people have on SNAP is that the stores they have access to arent the mega stores that sell at lower cost. They cant take advantage of purchasing in larger quantities because they never have enough up front.  They cant purchase a bottle of olive oil that lasts a long time and end up paying $0.25 per serving because they dont have the upfront money to do so.</p>

				<p>I generally shop at the neighborhood Fry&#8217;s supermarket. It&#8217;s smaller than the other grocery stores in our area, but it has a better meat department. Usually I drive a car to it for large shopping trips, but it is close enough to ride a bike to easily. My son walks up there regularly with his friends.</p>
<p>I just watch the sales and buy when it is cheap and use my freezer. I generally buy standard size packages of my ingredients. I change the menu to suit what is on sale or what I have in the house. I buy bagged spices for $0.89 to $1.09 per bag and reuse my bottles. Buying in the bottle adds $3.00 or more to the price of any spice. While it is not good for sandwiches, the $1.00 per loaf bread is perfect to make bread crumbs and croutons. Good day old bread works for other uses. I do have a breadmaker, but I know that most people don&#8217;t have one.</p>
<p>My daughter works at a general merchandise store where olive oil is $7.99 per liter less her 20% discount. Olive oil never spoils, but is usually available discounted somewhere. But you could have made the green beans using regular cheap veggie oil if you couldn&#8217;t get a good price on olive oil. </p>
<p>I also repurpose heavily. A whole chicken makes a great roast followed by soup or stew made with the carcass. Even a store bought rotisserie chicken can be used this way to make 2 or more meals. You throw away a meal when you toss the carcass.</p>
<p>I do plan ahead, but if I am at the end of the week&#8217;s budget, I will not buy a staple item and just modify my menu to use what I have. I do think that in this era of prepacked convenience cooking that many people don&#8217;t have the cooking skills that are needed to create these meals from basic ingredients. Premade frozen foods also destroy the budget.</p>

				<p>Having a working freezer/fridge/oven/range/car is not guaranteed in the US. Heck, even a working roof isn&#8217;t guaranteed. Without a working freezer, buying in bulk is somewhere between impractical and impossible. Without a working oven/range, cooking is somewhere between impractical and impossible. (Have you ever tried cooking a whole chicken on a hot plate? It may be possible, but it&#8217;s not simple.) Without a working car, chances are you&#8217;re spending an hour or so commuting, which makes preparing meals from scratch somewhere between impractical and impossible. Also, without a working car, chances are you&#8217;re out of range of decent supermarkets.</p>
<p>One of the ironies of US economics is that you need to have a certain amount of economic stability in order to eat cheaply.</p>

				<p>It is true that we are spoiled by our cooking facilities in America, but many cultures around the world can cook healthy meals with very limited equipment. You have to adapt your menu.<br />
I do have a normal fridge / freezer combo and a 3 burner stove.</p>
<p>When I was young, my father did not work summers and we traveled all over US and Canada every summer. We lived in a tent and cooked on a 2 burner Coleman stove all summer long. We always had full balanced meals just like we had at home. we were not rich and always stayed in no fee unimproved forest service camp grounds. We had a frugal lifestyle year round too..The point is that you do not need a fancy kitchen to cook good food</p>
<p>My situation is not as bad as many peoples, but I struggle to keep my family in housing and fed. My wife, Trina, developed ovarian cancer in 2006 and I provided full time hospice care for her for 3.5 years because she was very ill. As a result, we lost everything that we had worked for including our company and our house because her family looted it while I was caring for her. My company had provided fully paid health insurance for everyone (including their families) along with good wages. Now I am too old or over qualified for anyone to hire me. I work as a consulting chemist and restore vintage motorcycles to support my family. But work is scarce, so some months are good and some months, i have very little income.</p>
<p>But I have fed my family for many years on a low budget. I am lucky because I have a good family and a place to live.</p>

				<p>A two burner Coleman stove is an improvement over a hot plate.<br />
I&#8217;m not sure you understand just how important your freezer is to your ability to purchase cheap food in bulk, and how ridiculous your comments about buying a chicken one day and eating several meals from it are for someone who lacks a fridge/freezer. Storing leftovers in a poorly ventilated apartment (because the landlord won&#8217;t fix the place) or in a car (because you don&#8217;t have even an apartment) is a recipe for disease, not nutrition. As I understand it, SNAP can&#8217;t be used to buy ice, so even if someone gave them an icebox, it wouldn&#8217;t do much good&#8230;</p>

				<p>I hate to be the bearer of bad news, EML- but the funds on a card CAN be sold&#8230;.all the dealer (or family member) has to do is go to the store with the cardholder and pick out what they want on the card. It happens more than you think.</p>

				<p>He did his &#8220;test&#8221; for a week.  Talk to me when he&#8217;s tried it for a few months.  And after he pays his workers well enough that they themselves don&#8217;t need SNAP.  Then I might believe his propaganda.  Because until then, that&#8217;s all it is.</p>

				<p>What kind of jerk would diss a millionaire who doesn&#8217;t have to address this issue for forcing himself to live of food stamps for a week. So, he has to do it for months to meet your approval? Get a life and do something positive with it.</p>

				<p>What kind of idiot thinks that doing a publicity stunt, while his own employees are on SNAP, is addressing the issue?  I repeat, when he pays HIS OWN EMPLOYEES well enough that they don&#8217;t need SNAP, then he&#8217;s actually doing something.  Otherwise, it&#8217;s simply a publicity stunt to make him look concerned.</p>

				<p>We usually had hamburger flour, sugar and eggs. Just about everything we had was made from scratch. It made the food stamps go farther. My father well he was in the Army went to Vietnam. I hate it when people give blanket examples of what they perceive as typical food stamp recipients, I see people with cart with nothing but staples all the time. Sure there are people who screw the system rich and poor. When I look at what I have paid in taxes over the years I believe I have repaid many times over with interest. Of course I didn&#8217;t join the Army so I can say I also think the system should change.</p>

				<p>I work with the homeless mentally ill. The homeless have almost no choice but to eat at long food lines, which many mentally ill can&#8217;t handle, or from which they have been excluded for behavioral issues. Some fast food places have started accepting food stamps, after program rules changed. Money of any kind doesn&#8217;t go far at those places. Some bagged food programs don&#8217;t allow participation unless you can prove you have resources to store and cook it.<br />
    Years ago when I worked at a day center for them that did not a food program, Panera in San Diego would donate huge bags of day-old product that went a long ways towards filling the need. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never forgotten that.</p>

				<p>It just kills me when people talk about abuse of the food stamps program, or that they see people buying cigarettes, alcohol, etc., or selling them for cash to buy drugs. They&#8217;re either lying through their teeth, or referencing something from 30 years ago.</p>
<p>First of all, food stamps are not &#8220;stamps&#8221; &#8211; there are no separate pieces of paper. You get a debit card that has set amount on it. You can&#8217;t sell or trade anything.</p>
<p>Second of all, food stamps will not buy cigarettes or alcohol. They also cannot be used to buy toilet paper, paper towels, diapers, baby bottles, soap, shampoo, aspirin, cough medicine, band-aids, and anything else in your bathroom. You can&#8217;t buy anything for the kitchen that isn&#8217;t food. You can&#8217;t buy stamps. You can&#8217;t buy school supplies for your kids. You can&#8217;t get your worn out shoes repaired. You can&#8217;t put gas in your car or pay for a bus pass. You can&#8217;t go to the laundrymat.</p>
<p>SNAP is for an emergency, and is food, only. You can&#8217;t live on it. Yet we have millions of people who are forced to try to live on it, through no fault of their own.</p>
<p>I always wonder why people who want to stop the SNAP program think it&#8217;s okay to end a program that millions depend on because of a few bad apples. I wonder how many of them  also claim we can&#8217;t end gun rights because of a few &#8220;bad apples&#8221;&#8230;</p>

				<p>People make stupid assumptions. If I go to the store and buy a bunch of things some food and some not and I swipe my EBT card, others might assume I paid for everything with it. What really happens is the computer calculates the eligible food total only and charges that to the EBT card. Then I have to somehow pay for the rest some other way.</p>

				<p>There are many small stores that will tally your cigarettes and beer up and ring you up for the equivalent in food sales, usually rounding up the price a few dollars to make a tidy little profit. Some will even do the same for cash, charging anywhere from $1 to $2 per $10 of &#8220;food&#8221; charged. If there is a way to make money off something you can be sure people will find a way.</p>

				<p>It is a card, and you can sell them. On the street food stamps go for 50/100. That means you sit in the car while someone takes your food stamp card inside, you give them your PIN number, and they spend $100 of your food stamps, and they, in return, give you $50. If you only want to sell $30 on your food stamps, you will receive $15. Weather it is $15 cash, or $15 in pills or drugs, that is how it is done on the &#8220;streets&#8221;. Also, at gas stations that manually enter a price, ussually locally owned BP&#8217;s or AMERISTOP&#8217;s or SUNOCO, they can enter your cigarettes as food, because they are just entering a price&#8230; and they usually charge an extra fee for doing the favor.</p>

				<p>I personally think the problem isn&#8217;t so much the food stamps as it is what can be purchased.  Eliminate the ability to buy soda, chips, candy, prepared cookies etc.  Learn to cook!  While I stand there in the store with my ground beef and flour, sugar and eggs and I see their cart full of junk food and they whip out that food card.  I get tired of seeing a cart full of soda, chips and little debbies cakes and I know I have to prepare my own sweets for my family.  we pay cash, the cash we earned and can&#8217;t buy all that junk.  we eat healthy, and by not buying all that junk, we can afford the fresh fruits and vegetables.  the system needs changed!</p>

				<p>If you have $6 to spend and have to feed your kids, what will you spend it on? (It also depends on where you live. Food is more expensive in Los Angeles and Honolulu than it is in Kansas City or Fargo.) Fresh fruit and vegetables cost more than processed food, unfortunately. Buy two pound of apples and you&#8217;ve used up half the allotment right there. Whereas you can get maybe six boxes of mac &amp; cheese on sale and a pack of hot dogs, and you&#8217;ve got dinners for six days. A box of healthy cereal can cost upwards of $5, while a box of sugar flakes will go on sale for $2. You can get two and feed your kids breakfast for a week. Snacks? Two bags of store-brand potato chips for the price of one, or a pint of generic ice cream on sale for $2.00, versus a box of granola bars or fresh fruit sorbet for $5 each. (Poor children deserve a treat, too.) Fresh fish for $3 a pound (and how much fish do you get per person with that?) vs a bag of frozen fish sticks for $2.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that poor people are sometimes so unhealthy? Bad food is cheap food, but at least cheap food can put on the table.</p>

				<p>to add to that, a lot of people aren&#8217;t poor because they had bad things happen to them. Yes, some. I am not denying the GM plants closing and people loosing thousands of jobs&#8230; but, A lot of people are poor because they were never taught how to do good. You work full time for minimum wage and are struggling to pay your rent, electric, gas for work, car insurance, the LAST thing on your agenda is learning how to make home made bread. You get off work at 5, cook a quick meal, do kids home work, take baths, go to bed, repeat. Not everyone was taught growing up, how to cook or plan meals. Nobody learns in school how to balance a check book, how to spend wisely, how to cook wholesome meals, how to shop for car insurance. If your parents weren&#8217;t taught, you won&#8217;t be taught. Unless you have enough time on your hands, you will never learn.</p>

				<p>Teri Owen you can buy anything you want. education is the key. i taught health education to young girls with babies. she didn&#8217;t know why her baby was sick and crying all the time. i told her get a pear or apple instead of that candy. she was grateful. the Arab doctor &amp; store wasn&#8217;t.</p>

				<p>I think what you don&#8217;t understand, is that those products that you mention are the cheapest thing in the store.  Ground beef costs $4/pound, eggs cost $3/18.  The truth is that fruit and vegetables are very expensive.  My family recently went vegetarian, and we were amazed to find out that our food costs exploded!  The problem is that the government subsidizes corn, and this makes soda with corn syrup, corn chips, and snack cakes also made with corn syrup, very cheap, while other products are expensive by comparison.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m not a recipient, I pay INTO the program&#8230;and I find your comment completely distasteful!! I challenge you to take every extra item out of your pantry, including spices other than salt and pepper, 2 cans each of soup/veggies. You can have ketchup and mustard, ah heck even mayo if you&#8217;d like&#8230;but that&#8217;s it.  Now you live on a welfare budget, and see how difficult it is for some that are broke to start, to make an entire meal with just those things.  You CAN&#8217;T.  You MUST buy staples, have a pantry full of things in order to put a meal together&#8230;this include biscuits (homemade) cornbread, etc.  You think it&#8217;s easy for some of them, then you my dear are dead wrong.  Let&#8217;s just hope that at no point in your life, you EVER run into hard times, and need assistance, you won&#8217;t survive!</p>

				<p>You have $13.50 for a day&#8217;s worth of food for you, your spouse and your child &#8212; you decide that you&#8217;re going to cook everything because it&#8217;s healthier and you&#8217;re tired of the comments and glares for buying soda and TV dinners,  but your cupboards are bare. You need flour, sugar, milk, salt, pepper, oil, margarine, bread, milk and eggs &#8212; you are now past your $13.50 &#8211;and you&#8217;ve not bought anything to EAT  much less enough to prepare anything of value &#8212; so you put it back and you get soda because $0.89 for a 2 liter is less expensive than a gallon of milk at $3; you get white bread because it&#8217;s almost half the cost of wheat; you get a package of cookies because your kids deserve a treat now and then and it would cost almost $10 to make them from scratch. You get macaroni and cheese with hot dogs for dinner and once again you&#8217;re up to your budget for the day and  you know that the nutrion is severely lacking &#8212; but your children will not feel hungry and be able to sleep &#8212; and you feel like a heel  &#8212; and society is going to do everything to make you feel worse &#8212; and instead of understanding that it&#8217;s DAMN hard &#8212; they will point to the soda and junk instead of the hard work it is to be poor.</p>

				<p>I had to go on SNAP for my daughter and myself after her mother left us.  I worked full time but did not make enough on a single income to support the two of us.  Do you know what my &#8216;benefits&#8217; amounted to?  $57/month.  After paying bills and incidentals to take care of the two of us for the month I was lucky to have $50 for food so that extra $57 made one hell of a difference.  Did I but TV dinners, hot dogs, mac &amp; cheese and whatever else was cheap? You bet your ass I did, because I had to make the food last for as many meals as I could.  When off brand TV dinners are $1 each and an 8 pack of Hot Dogs are $1 each that&#8217;s dinner for a month for both of us with a couple bucks to buy cheap snacks like pre baked cookies and a bag of cheeto&#8217;s.  The fact is you do not know the circumstances of the people you are seeing in line buying pop, chips and cookies with their food.  For all you know they could be living in a group home and need to buy food they can store.  </p>
<p>My experience with the program led me to start my own charity group that focuses on making the lives of children better.  We donate time, money, and during the holidays gifts to needy families who have to choose between buying food or paying the bills (and holidays adds the burden of choosing to NOT but presents for the children).  Instead of knocking these people get to know them and their story.  Work with local groups to help change the system so they don&#8217;t have to rely on the system to feed their children.</p>

				<p>How wonderful that you can adopt the moral superiority to tell someone else how to live and raise their family. &#8220;Learn to cook&#8221;? That&#8217;s your solution? For all you know, that person in front of you in line may be working 2 or 3 jobs just to pay rent and utilities. How much time is left to cook? For all you know, a couple of kids might be looking forward to a glass of soda and an oh-so-extravagant Little Debbies cake once or twice a week for a treat that can make their humble lives seem a little more &#8220;normal&#8221;. Who has made you the arbiter of another&#8217;s life? If we eliminate that $4 &#8211; $14 a day food subsidy, what difference would it make in your life? None. But, the difference having that subsidy makes to a struggling family is the difference, literally, between life and death.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m homeless (living in my car). I&#8217;m sitting in my car right now picking up wifi that is left on after closing at a cafe. I have no place to properly store food and cook it. So, what do I eat? Cheap fast food, canned food sometimes, and junk food. I can get a meal&#8217;s worth of calories in a soda, bag of chips and a donut for less than $3. Please tell me about a mean&#8217;s worth of calories of healthy food I can buy for $3.</p>
<p>I get $200/month EBT.. That&#8217;s $6.67/day! Can you feed me for an entire day on that amount?  I&#8217;d love to be enlightened on how to get by all month on that. I never can.</p>

				<p>true. i wish i could have purchased a biscuit and a hash brown on McDonald&#8217;s dollar menu with my food stamp card while i was out bouncing  the pavement looking for an apartment before my housing assistance voucher expired. it would be a whole lot cheaper than that soda juice and potato chips. warm food is now cheaper so that regulation should change.even Wendy&#8217;s have $1.00 food/fries.</p>

				<p>The real private/public partnership that needs to occur is the private sector (companies) paying the public sector (employees) a living wage. I applaud all those that work to alleviate issues of hunger and poverty. But until people are paid a wage that shows them dignity, we will continue alleviating symptoms rather than the cause.</p>

				<p>This article brought tears to my eyes because it is so very true and people do not understand. I am disabled; due to an accident I went from earning about $6,000 per month to $1,300. I am grateful for the SS but it&#8217;s not enough to live on. I was widowed last year and had to apply for food assistance. They approved me and my daughter for $4.93 per day, and I am grateful for that too, but it is so hard.</p>
<p>It really isn&#8217;t anyone else&#8217;s job to support my daughter and me but it is nearly impossible for someone at the poverty level or disabled to sustain.</p>
<p>When we get on our feet I will patronize this business, this &#8216;test&#8217; shows they really do care.</p>

				<p>As you say, it isn&#8217;t anyone else&#8217;s job to support your daughter, but it does no one any good for you and your daughter to starve.  Your daughter is the future, she will help sustain the system in the future.  Consider the small amount that you receive as an investment made by our society to make sure that your daughter can grow and thrive, and contribute later in life!  I just wish that we would do more, without the stigma.</p>

				<p>it isn&#8217;t anyone else&#8217;s job to support you and your daughter &#8211; it&#8217;s everyone&#8217;s job to support you and your daughter and everyone else whose circumstances find them unable to make enough money for food, shelter, and clothing until you can get back on your feet or find yourself in better economic circumstances. some people may never find themselves in better economic circumstances but that does not mean that they should be denied the right to eat and sustain themselves. there are millions of hard-working people who have multiple jobs that pay almost nothing and thus still cannot make ends meet and they, too, should never be deprived the inherent human right to food.</p>

				<p>it is society&#8217;s duty to help take care of each other, that is a big part of what is wrong us today!!!  We are a fend for yourself and who cares about anybody society&#8230;  We need to lose mentality and take care of each other&#8230;</p>
<p>As for you buying Panera Bread, it is not affordable for their own employees&#8230;  I worked there for 2 years and had to fight tooth and nail just to get $8.25/hour, and I was 27 years old with the usual bills&#8230;  Needless to say, I also worked a part time job to help supplement and still couldn&#8217;t afford to eat here&#8230;  I was hired fulltime, worked over my scheduled shift, came in on my day off, and came in early when needed</p>
<p>Sure, he donates his left over pastries, bagels, and breads at the end of the day&#8230;  But his starving employees will get fired if they eat anything (including the discharged bread ends) without paying for it&#8230;  </p>
<p>He&#8217;s just showboating at this point&#8230;  When you only offer your GM&#8217;s insurance, pay your shift  manager&#8217;s that have worked for you for 6+ years barely $9/hour, and anybody below a shift manager, good luck getting a decent wage&#8230;  Panera Bread doesn&#8217;t like to give raises, and if you do find yourself lucky enough to receive a raise, it&#8217;s only $0.10</p>

				<p>I currently work part-time (15 to 18 hours per week) and get food stamps.  After 2 years of unemployment, the last 6 months of it without any unemployment benefits, I&#8217;m glad to have a part-time job.  I get $50.00 per month for food. Yes, you read that correctly. $50 a month for a family of one.  That&#8217;s roughly $1.67 budget per day for food.  Can I get enough healthy food (fresh fruits and veggies; good cuts of meat) to last me a month? Nope. Luckily I stocked up on soup and baking supplies (for bread, not cookies and cakes) before they cut my food stamps from $200 a month to $50 a month.  I don&#8217;t know why they cut it, they won&#8217;t tell me and they won&#8217;t raise it.  I&#8217;m glad for the $50 a month but not being able to afford healthy food sucks when you already have weight issues as well has high blood pressure.  I dare all of you who think people who collect food stamps are lazy to live on $1.67 a day or $50 a month for food and stay healthy &#8211; NO JUNK FOOD!   No eating out. No stopping at a gas station for a snack. No Starbucks. Purchase enough food to last you 2 or 3 meals a day (healthy meals) with only $50.</p>

				<p>This is what infuriates me when idiots like Limbaugh point at obese poor people and insist they clearly aren&#8217;t missing meals.  Healthy food is expensive.  Junk food isn&#8217;t, unless you throw in the healthcare costs when the diabetes and heart disease kicks in.  But then of course he bitches about poor people clogging up the hospitals too.</p>

				<p>We do need to ensure that people have the resources to feed their families properly. An honest living wage would help. Certainly cutting food programs is not helpful. And those folks who oppose SNAP will scream the loudest when they find themselves in hard times with no help.<br />
I am glad that he did this because it shows how difficult that it is. But it does not mean that you have to compromise a healthy diet, you just must be careful in what you buy and how you use it. It does take more than week to learn how to do it.</p>
<p>I have taken the challenge of feeding my family for the amount that you get in SNAP benefits. And it is possible. We have been doing it for several months now. Yes, I buy steak regularly, but it’s what you do with it that matters. First I buy clearance meat (except chicken) which costs about the same or less per pound as hamburger. This meat isn&#8217;t going be dodgey for at least a week more, but they need to sell it or toss it. Even salmon can be purchased for less than regularly priced hamburger meat which also occasionally makes it into the sale bin.</p>
<p>Put a good spice rub on the steak, broil it and then slice it thin. Serve it on $1.49 day old sub rolls with a 99 cent packet of sautéed frozen peppers and cheese with a side Caesar salad. Or slice it up and make a stir fry with packets of frozen veggies. Serve the stir fry over Ramen or rice. Or make it into Pad Thai or a curry. You can make our own Pad Thai or curry sauce for almost nothing using the ingredients in your pantry rather buying a $5.00 bottle of it. Home made enchiladas are another possibility to stretch the meat into many servings. You just fed an army of teenagers steak in a balanced meal for about $1.00 to $1.50 per serving. And they eat it quickly. But when my son or daughter goes over to their houses, all they have is frozen food and they complain that they have nothing good to eat. Their parents complain about how expensive their food budget is. Frozen veggies are the exception to the no frozen food rule since they prevent waste from spoilage of fresh veggies. Real cooking makes the difference.</p>
<p>Never buy soda; it&#8217;s just expensive water. Use the powered drink mix, add a splash of club soda when you pour it and you have the same thing for a fraction of the cost. You don&#8217;t have to give up coffee. Just buy the big bargain tin of it for less than the cost of a bag of designer coffee. It is good coffee. Save the morning&#8217;s leftovers to make iced coffee.Saved coffee, a dollop of cheap ice cream and ice in a blender makes those $5.00 frozen drinks that we are all fond of.  </p>
<p>You can eat “luxury” foods on a budget, if you use them correctly. Good food equals good nutrition, something that isn’t found in the frozen food or hamburger helper diet. Good nutrition creates benefits like better grades and better health. Be creative, eat well and don’t spend a fortune on food.</p>
<p>PS You can make a lot of lobster rolls or salad or a huge lobster pizza from a couple of sale lobster tails. Again at a low cost per serving.</p>

				<p>Note that a family of 3 receives a maximum benefit of $526 per month or $17.50 per day. A single person gets $ 200 or $6.60 per day<br />

<p>According to the USDA, the average per person benefit is about $ 134 per month or $ 4.65 per day although single people get less. This works out to $14.00 per day for a family of 3.<br />

				<p>No, not everyone gets $200 a month. Here it depends on how much you make. I get under $100. I buy fruits and veggies (can&#8217;t afford organic) and $1.20 organic macaroni and eat once a day. The card doesn&#8217;t cover toilet paper or anything that isn&#8217;t edible or drinkable (besides alcohol which isn&#8217;t covered either for obvious reasons). Yes there are people that use it and don&#8217;t need it.  But just because  say 1% of the people are selfish con artists doesn&#8217;t mean the other 99% doesn&#8217;t need it to survive. The urban legend of the lobster food stamp receipt conservatives use as an argument was a person selling the lobster and using the money to buy other things which is fraud. They weren&#8217;t having so much extra money that they were eating like kings 3 meals a day. Why not put in place investigators and a report system and not punish everyone for the bad judgement of a few.</p>

				<p>I worked for Panera as a manager for 5 years. I am very proud of the things the company does for communities. Every night anything left over is donated and the Panera Cares cafes are a fantastic asset to the communities. What I do have an issue with is the people the company employs are the people on the SNAP program! My highest paid associate was making $9 per hour and she had been there for more than 8 years. If the CEO wants to make a real difference, he needs to improve the rate of pay in his own company. The pay for my associates is the only thing I ever was angry about while working there. The raise program was a joke and I felt bad for so many, that worked so hard, for so little.</p>

				<p>Thank you for posting this because my very first thought was &#8220;how much do you pay your employees and what is your annual profit?&#8221; If corporations want to end hunger then hire more people, pay them more and stop the movement of money from the lowest and middle classes to the richest sector. If corporations really wanted to support society they would pay their employees so they could afford to actually purchase the products they sell.</p>

				<p>Oh give me a break, it&#8217;s not that hard. When i really want to save money i can live on $3.50 a day. Obviously you won&#8217;t be eating lobster but you can mange to have hot meals. NO MORE help to people who are lazy. Yes, some really do need it, but most of those receiving this benefit are working the system and instead should be out working, tutoring, baby sitting, answering phones, freelancing&#8230;COME ON! The poor actually eat better than the rest of us low-middle class&#8230;.so no sympathy from me! <a href="http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/government/ss/Lobster-Steak-Food-Stamp-Receipt.htm" rel="nofollow">http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/government/ss/Lobster-Steak-Food-Stamp-Receipt.htm</a></p>

				<p>Agreed &#8212; $3.50/day is not per meal &#8212; it&#8217;s $1.17 per meal &#8212; and in order to do what is necessary it implies a fully stocked pantry &#8211;which &#8211;well isn&#8217;t going to happen on foodstamps</p>

				<p>$3.50 a day I hardly doubt that unless you are literally eating one meal a day, because as of today just to buy outright all the fixing to make a single box of Mac and Cheese if you didn&#8217;t have anything in your house would cost more than $3.50. Even here in Washington where the limit is $200 a month a little over $6 dollars a day with the prices now a days of food it still does go very far</p>

				<p>Not that it makes any difference to you, but&#8230;. About 72 percent of SNAP recipients live in households with children; more than one-quarter live in households with seniors or people with disabilities.   Fraud and mis-payment amounts to 3.8% of SNAP payments, compared to 17% fraud and mis-payment to the IRS.  In fiscal year 2012, USDA’s retailer fraud investigations resulted in 342 convictions and $57.7 million in recoveries.  When cases of SNAP fraud are reported in the news, it is because the offenders have been caught, evidence that states and USDA are aggressively combating fraud.  In the lame example you posted, you apparently failed to note that the person committing the fraud was busted and jailed.  Every dollar of SNAP aid stimulates the economy by $1.78   It&#8217;s called the Multiplier Effect.   Don&#8217;t believe any of this..?  Look it up for yourself.  Fox News (?) is lying to you again.</p>

				<p>Can&#8217;t help but be cynical. I see so much abuse. Folks having money to buy cigarettes, booze, etc. Until I can be assured that families receiving benefits are using their taxpayer&#8217;s support wisely, I will remain a skeptic. I was on food stamps and assistance for less then six months almost 30 years ago. I had no problem putting food on the table. I respected and valued the gift of &#8220;temporary&#8221; assistance and did not abuse it.</p>

				<p>Who are any of us to judge? The system is far from perfect, I&#8217;ll give you that, and I&#8217;ve seen SNAP turn away people who were working for Americorps and are legally entitled to food stamps.  But the point is this: We have citizens starving everyday in this country, many of whom are children and we have a responsibility to provide for.  Who gives a crap if someone buys booze with their SNAP money? That&#8217;s their business, not yours.  You think that ONE person should be the reason MILLIONS of others go hungry? Because you seem to think you&#8217;d spend your food stamps oh-so-righteously? Haven&#8217;t these people been judged enough?  Seriously, learn some compassion for your fellow man.  It isn&#8217;t all about you, big boy.</p>

				<p>singlequeergrrl &#8212; I &#8220;give a crap&#8221; if someone buys booze with their SNAP money. It IS my business. You want to know why? Because as a taxpayer, I help fund these programs. If they didn&#8217;t rely on SNAP or other taxpayer-funded programs, they are MORE then welcome to drink themselves into a drunken stupor. However, as it stands, if they are using taxpayers money, they are beholden to the rules. And as far as being judged. Perhaps a little shame wouldn&#8217;t be such a bad thing. When we are seeing generational poor on government programs meant to be temporary, maybe some societal shunning is just the stimuli they need to get off their butts and make something of themselves. Don&#8217;t give me lip about how these people work so hard just to barely make ends meet. I work full time, make a living, AND help pay for these programs. Where is my medal, then?</p>

				<p>You&#8217;re a taxpayer? What a tired argument. Your tax dollars go to fund a lot of things I&#8217;m sure you disagree with, like multiple wars, but you&#8217;re going to draw the line at what poor people buy at the grocery store?  You&#8217;re also assuming that these people are not and have never been taxpayers, and for the vast majority that&#8217;s just not true.  Most people on SNAP do have jobs, do pay taxes, and still don&#8217;t make enough to make ends meet.  Would you say Americorps participants are not giving back to their community? They&#8217;re entitled to food stamps.  So if on their day off they want to buy a beer, why is that such an insult to you? They spend the rest of their time serving the community. </p>
<p>The bottom line is this: You don&#8217;t know who&#8217;s on food stamps and you don&#8217;t know what the circumstances are when you see someone using their food stamps to buy whatever they do.  As for shame being a good thing, that&#8217;s simply false.  Shame is good for nothing except controlling people, and there are dozens of studies showing what an extreme and negative impact shame has on both physical and mental health.  So yeah, if you want to see people get back on their feet, shaming them when their vulnerable is NOT the way to go. </p>

				<p>You&#8217;re making awfully big assumptions about who&#8217;s actually on food stamps, and an incorrect one at that.  MOST of the people receiving SNAP benefits are actively working taxpayers&#8211; just like you! They only difference is that they need a little extra help, maybe because they&#8217;re raising several kids on one income or perhaps because they&#8217;re an Americorps volunteer.  Americorps spend their time giving back to the community and make less than minimum wage without benefits doing it&#8211; so who am I to judge one of them if they want to go buy a beer on their day off? You seem to think everyone on food stamps is a freeloader, and it&#8217;s just not the case. </p>
<p>As for shame being a good thing, that&#8217;s crap.  Shame&#8217;s only function is to manipulate people into doing what you want.  Not to mention that there are dozens of studies on the impact of shame and stigma&#8211; turns out it&#8217;s extremely detrimental to both physical and mental health.  SO, if you&#8217;re goal is to see these people get back on their feet, shame is not the way to do it.  </p>

				<p>&#8220;I see so much abuse.&#8221; No you don&#8217;t. You see folks slide an EBT card to get their benefits and that ONLY can be used on food items. No cigarettes. No booze. Hell, not even toilet paper. You&#8217;ve heard some second-hand story or read a bunch of right wing garbage. You&#8217;ve NEVER seen any abuse. Yeah, and 30 years ago, food cost less and the cost of living was less.</p>

				<p>if you see someone trying to buy cooked chicken at the grocery store feel sorry for them because they have to put that back and get the cold sub sandwich if there&#8217;s enough on the card. while their working friend get to go out with that good smelling food. so beer &amp; wine is definitely out.</p>

				<p>The only assurance that you need, is to know that people cannot use foodstamps to buy booze and cigs.  I&#8217;m not sure what you eat, but $300 or $400/mo does not go very far.  If you eat rice and beans, vegetables and fruit, you will spend more than that.  The point is that, yes, you can buy mac and cheese, and instant soups, but you will suffer in the future, and the  health care costs will outweigh the savings.  On top of that, 1 in 5 kids in this country go hungry at night.  Are they spending their money on booze and cigs too?</p>

				<p>So many in America are food insecure &#8211; myself included. I have a 14 year old son and nutrition is VITAL to his growth and development right now. I go into debt every month just from paying for food. I weigh 125 which is underweight for my 5&#8217;8 1/2 height because I sometimes don&#8217;t eat regularly myself to ensure HE has food. So on low energy I work my tail off, little sleep, improperly nourished and totally afraid of getting sick because I&#8217;m the only parent and bread winner in the family. Remember, you don&#8217;t want to pay for my healthcare, either. I also don&#8217;t have FS, even though I work for myself and my income fluctuates every month to the point I sometimes can&#8217;t even pay my rent in full, I make TOO MUCH MONEY to receive assistance. Get off your high horses!</p>

				<p>I applaud his effort for just TRYING to walk in the shoes of the poor for even JUST one week. How MANY in his position simply won&#8217;t even bother to go and look for themselves by volunteering for a charity. He not ONLY did that but actually put himself into the shoes of a person on SNAP and got to experience the difficulties firsthand.</p>

				<p>I have long been a fan of Panera for many reasons: their great food, their openness about nutrition and their longstanding commitment to hunger initiatives.  Their CEO really &#8220;getting it&#8221; and trying to help others just makes me want to support their company even more.  It&#8217;s nice to see some parts of corporate America taking responsibility and really helping out.</p>
